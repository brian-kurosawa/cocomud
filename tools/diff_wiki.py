"""This script diff3 the wiki pages to generate a translation.

The process of translating wiki pages can be summarized this way:
1. The wiki page is created in English.
2. This script is called for a translation (like 'fr', or 'es'...).
3. The English version of the wiki is downloaded and put into the translation.
4. The translator translates this file into another language.
(At this point, the translated wiki can be uploaded).
5. The English wiki page is modified.
6. This script is called again to update the translated page.
7. The old version of the wiki page in English is downloaded.
8. The newer version of the wiki page in English is downloaded.
9. With diff3, these files are compared with the translated page.
10. The translated page is marked with the new verison.
11. The translator can translate it and upload it.
12. ... And so on

For this reason, the version of the new English wiki page has to be
stored in the translated page.  This doesn't prevent conflicts when
several translators modify the same file at the same time (which,
hopefully, shouldn't occur), but several translators can work on
different files without bothering each other.

Requirements:
    This script needs 'python-redmine', which you can obtain with
        pip install python-redmine
    It also needs a 'diff3' application accessible through the standard
    path.  It may require some installing on Linux.  On Windows, 'diff3'
    can be found in Cygwin.  If a better solution can be found, you're
    welcome to update this script.
