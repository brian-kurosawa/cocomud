"""Audio library, to play sounds in various formats.

This package includes:
-  The `pybass` library, to play sounds using `BASS`, a rhitd-party library
   with its own license.
-  A wrapper around the `pybass` library to make it easy to use `BASS` from
   CocoMUD.

Notice that, even though this package could be useful in other projects,
it is not released as a separate library and doesn't attempt to be used
outside of CocoMUD.  Hence, for instance, the wrapper is built with
Python 3.6 in mind and doesn't have any particular checks to be
compatible with other Python versions.

Wrapper usage:
1. From within CocoMUD, just import the wrapper:
       from audio import audiolib
2. `audiolib` is an instance of `AudioLib`, the wrapper used to
   communicate with `pybass`.  Therefore, `audiolib` could be considered
   as a standalone, although you could in theory create other objects
   of this class.
3. You can then use the methods of the `audiolib` instance to play sounds
   (see below).

Example:
    from audio import audiolib

    audiolib.play("path/of/my/file.ogg")
    # Or alternatively, to keep a handle on the played sound
    import time
    sound = audiolib.play("path/of/my/file.ogg")
    time.sleep(2) # notice that the sound will keep on playing while Python pauses
    sound.pause()
    sound.stop()
    sound.volume = 80 # 80% of volume
    sound.play() # unpause the sound

Frequently used methods:

- `AudioLib.play(str)`: play a sound, given the file path to access it.  `BASS` supports WAV, MP3, OGG and other formats (see the full documentation).
- `AudioLib.stop()`: stop all sounds that are currently playing.
- `Sound.play()`: start playing or unpause a sound.
- `Sound.pause()`: pause a sound.
- `Sound.stop()`: stop a sound.
