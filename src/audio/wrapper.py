"""Module containing the Python wrapper around the BASS library.

This module contains the `AudioLib` class.  It is not likely you will need to
import this module and manually create an instance of `AudioLib`, although
you can.  It's more likely you will import a single, preset instance of
`AudioLib`:

    from audio import audiolib

    # Use the AudioLib's methods on the `audiolib` object

"""

        generate: generate a Sound object from this file, do not play it.
        play: play an audio file, creating a Sound object.
        stop: stops all audio files.
