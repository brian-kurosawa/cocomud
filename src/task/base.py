"""Module containing the BaseTask class.

A task is an operation run in an independent thread.  It can be bond
to a dialog box with a progress bar.  This can be useful to report
progress in a foreground task.

Here's a very short example:

import time

from task.base import BaseTask
from ui.dialogs.task import TaskDialog

class Wait(BaseTask):

    "Task to wait a few seconds."

    def __init__(self):
        BaseTask.__init__(self)
        self.dialog = TaskDialog(self, "Wait for...")

    def execute(self):
        "Wait for several seconds."
        self.update(title="Waiting...")
        time.sleep(2)
        i = 0
        while i < 100:
            self.update(text="i = {}".format(i), progress=i)
            time.sleep(1)
            i += 1

And to use this class:

wait = Wait()
wait.start()
# That will pause the program and display the dialog with the progress
# bar.  The dialog will be destroyed when the task is complete or if
# the user clicks on the Cancel button.
print "After the task is finished or cancelled."
