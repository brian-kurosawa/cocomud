    All scriptable objects in CocoMUD should inherit this class at some
    level.  This class offers mechanisms for propagating modifications to
    linked objects.  This is necessary because of the abstraction of
    configuration level: every piece of scritpable in CocoMUD can be
    defined on the general level, a world level, a character level,
    or a category level.  Thus, scriptables are often connected together
    and, for every modification, they have to modify their peers.
