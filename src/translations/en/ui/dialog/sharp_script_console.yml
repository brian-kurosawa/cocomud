    This console allows you to enter SharScript instructions directly.  It is a very
    handy tool to quickly configure aliases, macros, triggers and so forth, as long
    as you know the SharpScript syntax in CocoMUD.  Here's an example you can enter
    here:
        #say Hi!
    Or:
        #say {{Here's a longer message.}}
    Or even:
        #say {{This message shouldn't appear on the screen.}} -screen
    You can also enter instructions on several lines, which is necessary if you need
    to use the SharpScript syntax to include Python code.  This advanced syntax is
    useful for complex triggers.  To do so, end your first line with {{+ to tell the
    engine this line isn't the end of the instruction:
        #trigger {{HP: }} {{+
    ... then on the next lines, write the Python code by indenting it slightly to the
    right.  When your block is over, add an empty line with the }} symbol, with no
    indentation.  Only then, your lines will be sent to the SharpScript engine.
