"""This file contains the 'safe' system of CocoMUD, ways to crypt/encrypt.

This feature requires:
    pbkdf2
    Crypto

The module contains a class named 'Safe', that should be insantiated
in order to manipulate the encrypting
/decrypting mechanism.  This class requires a passphrase in
argument.  You can insantiate it as follows:
>>> from safe import Safe
>>> safe = Safe(file=".passphrase")
>>> # (If the file doesn't exist, it will be created with an auto-generated
>>> # passphrase.)
>>> # Alternatively you can specify the passphrase directly
>>> safe = Safe(passphrase="Dsm18fvdjP9sz801,9DJA.1356gndYJz987v")
>>> # Store encrypted data
>>> safe.store("login", "kredh")
>>> safe.store("password", "YoudWishIToldYou")
>>> # Retrieve the data (can be later)
login = safe.retrieve("login")
password = safe.retrieve("password")
